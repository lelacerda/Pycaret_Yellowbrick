# Pycaret_Yellowbrick
This projectÂ´s objective is to compare a prediction model using Pycaret3 and Yellowbrick, that is based on Scikit-learn. 

The dataset used is the Halifax Stanfield Airport weather information provided by the [Government of Canada website](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_stations_e.html?searchType=stnName&timeframe=1&txtStationName=Halifax&searchMethod=contains&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2023&Year=2023&Month=3&Day=21&selRowPerPage=25)

The data has been previously cleaned and saved as a [CSV file](https://github.com/lelacerda/Pycaret_Yellowbrick/blob/main/df_clean.csv)
